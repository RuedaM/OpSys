What is an operating system?


**** a (large-scale) program that allocates and manages resources

       for other programs ****


     OPERATING SYSTEM  ==  RESOURCE MANAGER




-- Resource allocation
   (memory management, process scheduling, disk access, I/O, etc.)

-- Program execution -- fork()
   (load programs into memory, run/suspend/terminate programs,
    handle/display errors)

-- Filesystem manipulation
   (read/write/traverse filesystem directories,
    read/write/traverse files, enforce permissions/security)

-- Interprocess Communication (IPC)
   (processes exchange information via shared memory,
    message passing, sockets, pipes, files, etc.)
   (key challenge: synchronization)

-- Error detection and recovery
   (Detect errors in CPU, memory, I/O, processes, etc.)
   (Recover from errors gracefully)

-- Account and resource protection/security
   (Users, groups, account verification, memory protection, etc.)

-- Usage monitoring
   (processes, users, networks, log files, etc.)
