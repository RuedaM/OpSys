SERVER TYPES:

(0) udp-server.c --- iterative server (often UDP):
    accept incoming UDP datagrams on a specific port number;
    or accept and handle TCP connections one after the other
     (also udp-server-random.c)

(1) udp-server-w-fork.c --- multi-process UDP server:
    a child process is created to handle each received UDP datagram


HOMEWORK 4: (most likely) TCP server (maybe also supporting UDP)
             to play Wordle   ^^^^^^
