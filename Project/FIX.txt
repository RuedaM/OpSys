simout stuff:
- CPU bound avg CPU burst time, output5
- overall avg IO burst time, output2

FCFS simout calculations - certain values are off by a thousandth between outputs:
- CPU bound + IO bound avg wait time, output4, output5
- overall avg wait time, output4
- CPU bound avg turnaround time, output3, output4, output7
- IO bound avg turnaround time, output5

SJF fully wrong
- output7

SJF simout - some are fully wrong
- CPU util, output7
- CPU + IO + overall bound avg wait time, output2, output3, output4, output5, output6, output7
- CPU + IO + overall bound avg turnaround time, output2, output3, output4, output5, output6, output7
